# Photography Portfolio Website
>Developed by [Alex Yang](https://github.com/aqyang28).

## Overview

This project is a photo gallery website displaying some of my favorite shots to share my work with anyone interested. I am using my Google Sites photo website as a template for the design. This project marks my first time using web application frameworks and languages. I have learned a lot about the basic structure of CSS and JavaScript. I have also developed more proficiency in using Git to manage my project locally and on GitHub. I have set three primary goals to work towards in the next stages of development:

### Next Steps:
- **Accessibility features:** Include alt text for all images to make them accessible to screen readers.
- **Dynamic sizing:** Ensure the design is responsive across multiple devices and screen sizes by replacing hardcoded `px` values with `rem` or `em` units.
- **User interface updates:** Improve the UI to enhance user experience and boost performance by fixing spacing between elements on the About page and scaling images to fit or dynamically sizing them to .

### Future Goals:
- Integrating the Google Calendar API to display my availability for photo sessions.
- Implementing a structured database to handle user booking requests.
- Adding more images to the gallery.

This README file will be updated as I progress through this creation. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
