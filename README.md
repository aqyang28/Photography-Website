# Photography Portfolio Website
>Developed by [Alex Yang](https://github.com/aqyang28).

## Overview

This project is a photo gallery website displaying some of my favorite shots with the purpose of sharing my work to anyone who is interested. This project marks my first time working with web development languagesâ€“ I have already learned a lot and am excited to learn a lot more. I have set three primary goals to work towards in the next stages of development:

1. **Accessibility features:** include alt text for all images to make them accessible to screen readers.
2. **Dynamic sizing:** ensure the design is responsive across multiple devices and screen sizes by replacing hardcoded px values with rem or em units.
3. **User interface updates:** improve the UI to enhance user experience and improve performance.

Future goals include: Google Calendar API implementation to make a calendar displaying my availability for sessions, a database that allows users to send booking requests online, and even more pictures. This README file will be updated as I progress through this creation, thanks for joining me on this journey!
